## Working and Methodology: 

### Frontend:
The frontend is developed using React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. 
The application is hosted on Netlify, ensuring accessibility for users. 

The frontend comprises several components:
Login Component: Allows users to log in using their credentials.
Signup Component: Enables new users to create an account.
Registration Form Component: Provides a form for users to register for yoga classes.
Payment Component: Handles the payment process.

### Backend:
The backend, hosted on Render, manages API requests and interactions with the MongoDB database. 

Key backend components and functionalities include:

Authentication (JWT)
JWT (JSON Web Token): JSON Web Tokens are used for secure authentication. 
After successful login, a JWT is generated and sent to the frontend. 
This token is included in subsequent requests to authenticate and authorize users.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
CORS Middleware: CORS is implemented to handle cross-origin requests securely.
This middleware allows or restricts cross-origin resource sharing based on defined policies. 
It enhances security by preventing unauthorized access.

Routes and Controllers
Auth Routes: Handle user authentication, including login and signup functionalities.
Registration Routes: Manage user registration for yoga classes.
Payment Routes: Handle payment-related functionalities.

Models (MongoDB)
User Model: Represents user data, including username, email, and password. Stored in the MongoDB database.
Registration Model: Stores details of user registrations, including name, email, age, gender, and batch timing.

Database (MongoDB)
Database Connection: The backend establishes a connection to the MongoDB database to store and retrieve user and registration data.
Schema Design: Schemas define the structure of user and registration data, ensuring consistency and integrity.


## Database Schema
